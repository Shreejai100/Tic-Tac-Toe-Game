# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, with real-time validation of winning combinations and a draw scenario. The game features a reset and new game functionality and provides clear messages to announce the winner or declare a draw. The logic includes checking for win conditions based on predefined patterns and ensuring smooth turn-taking between players X and O.
